# devclub-recruitment-asignment

I've attempted Part I and Part II. The project was done using MERN Stack. I was contributing for Tryst'21 Backend and started this a bit late and thus was not able to complete Asignment. But I did manage to complete 90% of it with the part for accepting/rejecting requests by Librarian being left. Although I had to attempt only one of the Part I and Part II, I attempted both Part I and Part II(2 and bonus).



## Setup
Clone the Repository.

run command `npm i` in ./Part 1

create a `.env' file in Part 1 with variables which I submitted in Form. I didn't upload them directly as someone may mess up with Initial data in database


Run command `npm start `

run command `npm i create-react-app` in ./Part 2/apni-library

run command `npm start`

open `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` from your browser.
